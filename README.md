# Sigil_User_Guide_JP
Japanese translation of the Sigil_User_Guide_2022.05.17 (English version).
The original English version is now translated into Japanese in the same Sigil EPUB format.  .XTML and image files in Japanese are renamed with the suffix "_JP" to differenctiate from the original data.
Added two .XHTML files are added: one for ABBRIVIATED TERMS (terms_JP.xhtml) for Japanese readers, and the other errata.xhtml for which I found some "errors"? in the original text.
The document is provided as-is status and the translator accepts no liability for any loss resulting from the use of the file.
